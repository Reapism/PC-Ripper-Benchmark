# PC-Ripper-Benchmark
The PC-Ripper-Benchmark application is for Senior project BCS 430W. 
The is an extension of my original work located here: https://github.com/Reapism/CPU-Ripper

# What is the PC-Ripper Benchmark application?
Let's call it Ripper for short. The Ripper is an app designed
to benchmark many components on your computer. It also has the
ability to query a database that has many components attributes.
We're able to ask pretty good questions through these queries so
it's always expandable. The program will generate a *[Score]*(https://github.com/Reapism/PC-Ripper-Benchmark/wiki/Score "Score - wiki")
contingent upon an internal algorithm that looks at how the
test was conducted, time it took to complete, and iterations
per second or tick.

# How can I download the application?
You can download this application by cloning the solution or by
downloading it using the green clone/download button on the top.

# Is the Ripper open-sourced?
Yes. All the code from the ground up is available for you
to see. We will likely be using other libraries within this project,
and depending on the license, we may or may not include that source-code
in this repository. 

# Is there more documentation for this project?
YES. Please check the WIP Wiki tab!
